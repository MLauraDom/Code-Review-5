    Bonus Points:
    (10 points) You have decided to add an additional date/time property for every location (parent class) that you visited. You add that information “Created: 24.03.2021 12:45” to respective teaser displays.
    
    (10 points)  You want to use the newly added entry to create two additional pages to your system index-asc.html  and index-desc.html  Those pages are sorting the array of locations (places, events, restaurant) ascending/descending based on the “Created” date/time property. (If you feel capable of rendering the ascending and descending in one HTML page instead of creating extra index-asc.html/index-desc.html pages, then you are welcome to keep it on one page.)
